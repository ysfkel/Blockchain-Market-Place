The following measures were taking in order to ensure the smart contracts are not susceptible to common attacks

  ### Test Driven Development - TDD
       Inorder to ensure the smart contracts behave as intended, a Test First approach was followed.
       - Contract functions specification was written using a the Mocha testing framework as Chai assertions library
       - Tests were executed for failure
       - And then code was written to make the tests pass
       - Frequently, entire tests were run together to ensure new functionality did not introduce unintended behavior in the code
   
   ### Code Modularity / Object oriented design
        - Modulary: Common code is written in thesame contract inorder to abide by the Single Responsiblity principle
               this design was also taken into account while designing the function members of individual contracts.
               The benefits of this design include
               
               -  Minimised code duplication
               -  Better code readability
               -  code sharing via function calls
               -  better maintanability of code
