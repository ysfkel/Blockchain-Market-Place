WITHDRAWAL PATTERN

  DIRECTLY INVOKING THE TRANSFER FUNCTION ON AN ADDRESS IS A SECURITY RISK
  THE WITHDRAWAL PATTERN WAS USED TO ALLOW USERS TO KEEP TRACK OF ANY WITHDRAWALS THAT ARE 
  PENDING AND PROVIDES A SIMPLE WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION WHERE USERS (VENDORS) CAN TAKE 
  OUT THERE ETHER FROM THE CONTRACT. THIS MEANS INSTEAD OF THE CONTRACT FUNCTION
  DIRECTLY CALLING TRANSFER ON AN ADDRESSES AND POTENTIAL OPENING THEMSELVES 
  UP TO AN ATTACK, THE CONTRACT  UPDATES THE STATE OF THE PENDING 
  WITHDRAWALS , THIS WOULD THEN ALLOW THE EXTERNAL ADDRESS TO CALL INTO 
  THE WITHDRAWAL FUNCTION TO COLLECT ITS ETHER.
  THE IDEA IS THAT THE ATTACK VECTOR IS ALLOWED TO ONLY THE WITHDRWAL function
  AND THE ATTACKER CANNOT COMPROMISE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REST OF THE 
  CONTRACT
